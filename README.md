## Course Description
This course examines the specific role of the crime analyst within the context of law enforcement and the intelligence community. The objective of this course is to gain theoretical understanding and practical experience in the history, data, skills, and techniques related to crime analysis and crime mapping, through the use of current technology and conventional methodologies. This will involve the study and critique of current historical practices, application of criminological theories, and class work simulating real crime analysis functions. This will include data systems and collection, and the quantitative and qualitative analysis of short- and long-term criminal activity across space and time. This is a hands-on course designed to promote theoretical comprehension and realistic fieldwork. Upon completion of this course students should have a practical appreciation of social science analytics, a more nuanced understanding of their applications to crime and law enforcement, and preparation for entry into an analytics-based career trajectory.

This course fosters a skill-based and interactive environment for learning these principles. This course details the methods for transforming strategic and tactical data from various collection sources into tangible information and usable products for decision makers. Thus, it utilizes current technology and contemporary computer programs commonly used in functional criminal justice research settings. Students will be exposed to real data and real research questions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Comprehend crime data. Students will be exposed to real crime data, and learn how to work with tabular event-based records, assessing its quality, validity, and accuracy to derive findings.
- Apply criminological theories to real crime problems. Students will apply different theories of crime causation and policing models to data and analysis.
- Synthesize data, methods, and tools to understand crime. Students will become proficient in applications used by analysts across the local, state, federal, international, and private sectors.

## Projects
All projects expose students to a unique aspect of crime analysis, focusing on different datasets, technical applications, and analytic methods. The projects are divided into Strategic (3 projects), Tactical (4 projects), and the Final (2 projects). The Strategic projects involve creating graphs, maps, and a statistical forecast model. The Tactical projects include identifying a pattern, and conducting spatial, temporal, and predictive analysis. The Final projects allow students to recreate the Strategic or Tactical workflows, using new data.

Each project folder is organized into the following (where applicable):
- `README.md` — Project overview  
- `instructions/` — Project instructions in PDF format  
- `data/` — Dataset(s) used for analysis  
- `src/` — Source code files (e.g., R Markdown, scripts)  
- `outputs/` — Generated output files (e.g., HTML, PDF reports, CSV files)
